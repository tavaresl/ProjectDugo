# Conway's Container

> Made for OLC Codejam 2020

Fitting the theme "The Great Machine", in this game you take control of the rules of John Conway's Game of Life.
Your goal is to save as many populations as possible before the countdown ends.

Even though we did not have any previous experience with C++, we decided to use it to develop the game so we could try the `olcPixelGameEngine` as well.

We hope you like it :)
